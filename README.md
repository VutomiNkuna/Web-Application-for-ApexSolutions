SEN PROJECT 4: API DOCUMENTATION

Why we used the Twilio API
We decided to use the Twilio external API.
The Twilio API is a restful API. 
Reasons why we decided on a restful API:
•	Generally, RESTful APIs are easier to understand and uses standard HTTP methods.
•	Since RESTful API’s are know to be stateless, each request is independent from other interactions of the previous state.
•	The RESTful API is easier in terms of data format. While the most common format is JSON, the API can handle multiple different formats, such as HTML and plain text.
•	REST API’s have lower overhead and are thus generally faster.
•	Since REST API’s use standard HTTP methods and status codes, this makes it a lot easier to integrate with the system.
•	REST API’s  support standard HTTP-based security features, such at OAuth for authentication.
•	REST API’s indicates the success or failure of a request with HTTP status codes.
•	REST is stateless, thus it enhances reliability since the system does not need to recover between each transaction.
What does the API do
On the website  https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account-namer information can be found on how to use this API, in a short:
•	Twilio provides you with a free unique Twilio number that you can use for your messages. 
•	On this website you will have a dashboard you can use to send messages and view your authentication token as well as your SID
•	Using the authentication token and SID the website provides you with an example snippet of the code that you can use(Seen bellow)
 
 
•	 Since we are building in java, we extracted the java snippet and integrated it into our code.
How is the API integrated
The API uses a callback function that checks the job table to see if any jobs have a job status of unassigned. If it sees a job with no assignment, the API is initiated and all the unassigned technicians are sent a text message(Due to Twilio verification restrictions, and a lack of time to apply, the API only sends text to a virtual number hosted by Twilio)
